# News-Scraper-GUI
A News Scraper GUI to go along with my News Scraper CLI tool

First run `python .\News-Scraper-API.py` (API-Files > News-Scraper-API.py)
This will start the News Scraper API that theu GUI uses to retrieve the information from the News Websites

Then open `GUI-Files > index.html`

API and GUI styling still has some problems that need to be ironed out
Problems will be fixed soon
